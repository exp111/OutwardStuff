Ideas:
- Better item spawn panel with thumbnails, description, filters (type)
- Right click delete items
- /tp area
- /spawn enemy => https://www.nexusmods.com/outward/mods/216?
- chat history with arrow controls
- overwrite original commands or add better error handling to them => transpiler?
- item info which takes item id list and shows them pretty, spawnable
- fix invulnerability not working after rejoin
- disable autosave completely (even on world exit)
- /hurt
