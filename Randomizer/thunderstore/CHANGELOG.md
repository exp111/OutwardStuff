1.1.6:
- Added options to filter out specific checks if you dont want them randomized. Should work on a blacklist basis, meaning if you dont change anything, it wont break anything. If you still have any problems or a chest that shouldn't be randomized is randomized, please open an issue on GitHub.

1.1.5:
- Fix enemies spawning without custom armor and weapons
- Fix monster weapons not being saved
- Fix enemies spinning after being loaded from a save

1.1.4:
- Fix enemies having their original equipment in their inventory

1.1.3:
- Remove some items from the blacklist
- Optionally allow equipment with no icon to be generated (only 3 currently)

1.1.2:
- Limited the quantity of randomized non stackable items, so they don't fill up inventories that much anymore

1.1.1:
- Fixed monsters getting non monster weapons and thereby causing freezes during loading
- Modded items are now generated again
- Filtered some additional dev items
- Mod now logs seed for debug purposes

1.1: (Sinai did the heavy lifting here, so thanks for that <3)
- True Random now works even without changing areas
- Items are now filtered so you (hopefully) won't get broken items anymore
- The mod should run and load faster now
