# Inward
Connects your game to your hardware devices for that special kick.  
Uses the [buttplug.io library](https://buttplug.io/) to connect and control (mostly, but not exclusively) sex toys.

# Usage
For this plugin to work you need to have a buttplug.io compatible server such as [Intiface Central](https://github.com/intiface/intiface-central/) running.

The plugin tries to connect on game start. If that doesn't work you can reconnect/scan using the [BepInEx Configuration Manager](https://outward.thunderstore.io/package/Mefino/Outward_Config_Manager/).
